WatchMe - Android App (using Java)
Udacity Android Nanodegree - Project One and Two

Disclamer: Being a frum Jew, who never watches movies,
I did not want to do this project, but Udacity dictates
what the projects are and links them to our profile,
so deleteing this repository whould have a negative impact.

About: This App is the first two projects of the nanodegree.
It uses the movieDB Api to retreive the data and display it.

Instructions: You will need to add the gradle.properties file 
to the project,generate an api key from themovieDB and put 
your api key in there as such: API_KEY="your api key goes here"

The reason is simple - we cannot share publicly a private field,
which the api key is.
